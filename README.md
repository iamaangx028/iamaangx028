This is my little corner of the internet — an interactive portfolio I put together with a security-inspired look (kind of like a futuristic command center ✨). Here, I share the projects I've worked on, the skills I'm building, and bits of my journey in cybersecurity. I've also added an interactive blog system because I like writing down what I learn and turning it into stories others can follow.

## 🔒 Overview

Hi, I'm Aang (@iamaangx028). I'm learning and exploring cybersecurity, mostly around offensive security, penetration testing, and vulnerability research. This site isn't meant to be flashy — it's just a space where I can track my growth and share what I'm figuring out along the way.

One part I'm really excited about is the Security Intelligence Hub. It's my blog, but with a twist — it uses a graph-style navigation so you can literally follow the path of my learning journey and dig into technical insights as I discover them.
